          <h4>What are Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ships?</h4>
          <p>
            Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ships (ASDS) are seagoing vessels that serve as mobile landing 
            platforms for SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy boosters. These ships enable landings for 
            missions that don't have enough fuel to return to the launch site, such as geostationary 
            transfers or high-inclination orbits.
          </p>

          <h4>ASDS Fleet & Operations</h4>
          <p>
            SpaceX operates several droneships including "Just Read the Instructions" (JRTI) in 
            California, "A Shortfall of Gravitas" (ASOG) and "Of Course I Still Love You" (OCISLY) in 
            the Atlantic. These ships are equipped with thrusters to maintain position and capture 
            landing boosters.
