# SpaceX Tracker SX

A multi-surface SpaceX dashboard for following Starlink satellites, Falcon booster reuse, Dragon capsules, launch activity, and recovery infrastructure from one place.

## What This Project Is

SpaceX Tracker SX is a personal tracking dashboard backed by a small data pipeline. It combines:

- a React dashboard for browsing the data
- a FastAPI backend for ingest jobs and local development
- a Cloudflare Worker API for production delivery
- a PostgreSQL schema shared across the whole system

## What You Can Explore

### Starlink

- browse tracked Starlink satellites with search, filtering, sorting, and pagination
- inspect per-satellite records with orbital history snapshots
- view constellation-level stats such as active, decayed, and decaying objects

### Falcon Boosters

- compare boosters by missions, reuse count, landing record, and current status
- open detailed booster views with reuse missions and landing profile
- track fleet-level metrics such as total landings, reuse adoption, and max reuse depth

### Launches

- follow recent and upcoming missions from the same interface
- inspect launch summaries, launch windows, tags, and mission links
- keep booster and Starlink activity grounded in current launch cadence

### Dragon And Ground Infrastructure

- review Dragon capsule status and mission counts
- track landing zones and autonomous drone ships alongside the booster fleet
- keep recovery infrastructure in the same operational picture as the vehicles that depend on it

## Why I Built It

I like following SpaceX closely, but most sources only give part of the view. One place has launch schedules. Another has satellite data. Another has booster history. Useful on their own, but fragmented.

It brings together:

- Starlink satellite catalog and orbital history
- Falcon launch and landing performance
- booster-level reuse and mission history
- Dragon capsule status
- recovery infrastructure and current launch activity

The goal was simple: build something that makes the overall state of the program easier to see at a glance.

## Highlights

- one dashboard for Starlink, launches, boosters, capsules, landing zones, and drone ships
- local development API in Python and production API at the edge with Cloudflare Workers
- Postgres-backed data model shared across frontend, backend, and worker
- scheduled ingestion for both Starlink catalog data and SpaceX asset sync
- focused on readable operational context, not just raw tables

## Architecture

| Directory | Stack | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `frontend/` | Vite + React | Dashboard UI |
| `worker/` | Hono + Cloudflare Workers | Edge API (production) |
| `backend/` | FastAPI (Python) | Ingest/sync jobs + local dev API |

`backend/Schema.sql` defines the PostgreSQL schema used by both the worker and backend.

## Local Run

### 1. Database

```bash
psql "<DATABASE_URL>" -f backend/Schema.sql
```

### 2. Backend API (Python)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Run data jobs when needed:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python ingest.py              # Starlink satellite data from Space-Track
python sync_spacex_assets.py  # Booster/capsule data from spacexnow.com
```

### 3. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Worker (Cloudflare Workers local dev)

```bash
cd worker
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

### `backend/.env`

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
SPACETRACK_USER=your_username
SPACETRACK_PASS=your_password
```

### `worker/.dev.vars` (local dev only — use Cloudflare dashboard for production secrets)

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=require
```

### Frontend

`VITE_API_URL` is set at build time. Defaults to `http://localhost:8000` if unset.

For Cloudflare Pages, set it in the dashboard under **Settings → Environment variables**:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://<your-worker>.workers.dev
```

## Deployment (Cloudflare)

Prerequisites:

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

### Worker (Cloudflare Workers)

```bash
cd worker
npx wrangler deploy
```

Set `DATABASE_URL` as a secret in the Cloudflare dashboard (Workers → Settings → Variables) or via CLI:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
```

### Frontend (Cloudflare Pages)

```bash
cd frontend
VITE_API_URL=https://<your-worker>.workers.dev npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name starlink-tracker
```

## Data Sources

| Source | Used By | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| [space-track.org](https://www.space-track.org) | `ingest.py` | GP + SATCAT feeds for Starlink satellites |
| [spacexnow.com/stats](https://spacexnow.com/stats) | Worker + FastAPI | Falcon 9 mission/landing/reflight stats |
| [spacexnow.com/boosters](https://spacexnow.com/boosters) | `sync_spacex_assets.py` | Per-booster flight/landing data |
| [spacexnow.com/capsules](https://spacexnow.com/capsules) | `sync_spacex_assets.py` | Per-capsule mission data |
| [rocketlaunch.live](https://fdo.rocketlaunch.live/json/launches) | Worker + FastAPI | Recent + upcoming launches |
| [spacex.com/launches](https://www.spacex.com/launches/) | FastAPI (local) | Launch listing enrichment |

## GitHub Actions

Two scheduled workflows keep the database current:

- **Sync SpaceX Assets** — runs `sync_spacex_assets.py` to update boosters/capsules.
- **Ingest Starlink Data** — runs `ingest.py` to refresh satellite catalog and history.

Requires `DATABASE_URL`, `SPACETRACK_USER`, and `SPACETRACK_PASS` as repository secrets.
